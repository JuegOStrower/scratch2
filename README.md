# Scratch 2.0 Player
Play Scratch projects on the Scratch 2 Flash Player

Please love, favourite and follow me. That will help me making better projects.
It's not magic, you really can BRING SCRATCH 2.0 BACK!
Remember, it can only open projects that were last saved by Scratch 2.0.

HOW TO
Go to juegostrower.tk/scratch2 and paste the project id/link there. Then hit Go.
To add the Scratch 2.0 Player to Scratch, go to juegostrower.tk/scratch2/add and add a bookmark that, when you click it, changes between the Scratch 3.0 and the Scratch 2.0 Player.
If you need detailed instructions, read the project.
